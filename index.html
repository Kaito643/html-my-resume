            <p>
                I am currently sophomore student in TED University and I major Software Engineering. 
                I know Python and Java sufficiently. I am also learning SQL and HTML-CSS-JS. Other than 
                learning outcomes from my University I am highly interested in Cyber-Security and actively 
                imroving myself by community activities, educations and personal projects. I enjoy both 
                penetration testing and Security Analyzing. I want to find what I will be doing as my 
                career with my first internship and finally expertise on one of the fields. So I am both 
                open to voluntary and compulsary internships.

                        I aimed to be an engineer since middle school, first step I took towards this goal 
                        was going to a high school with STEM education. This school added me so many things.
                        Despite other schools we did not only go prepared for collage prep exam in our school,
                        we also learned web designing, and basic robotics with arduino.

                        2022 - Currently student
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After finishing half of my highschool, I knew I had to major something about software
                        and programming. TED did not only fill my hunger for software I also had the chance to 
                        participate in many activities. Thanks to TEDU I had chance to design projects for 
                        Non-Governmental organisation, GSM. I also attended my schools coomunity activities. 
                        Some of them are, I got accepted to the Board of Directors at TEDU E-Sports and I am 
                        actively participating in classes that Cyber Tedu is giving. I am aiming to build my 
                        career on Cyber-Security.

        <h2><li>Work Experience</li></h2>
            <p>
                I did not have much experience in the Industury. I am currently a sophomore student and looking 
                for internship and job opportunities for Cyber-Security.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to mention about the times I worked out of the industry. I still find it valable to work 
                in organizations to build the displine required for other workspaces.

                        <li>Friends, Summer Camps</li>

                                Summer Camp Coach,<br>
                                2021 - 2023
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These camps meant so much for me because I started as a camper when I was 14. 
                                Coaches at that time were so chariscmatic and role-model for me I decided to 
                                be a coach for smaller kids when I grow up. I both took responsibility of kids 
                                and the facility for the camp area while I was working. I also enjoyed working 
                                with kids.

                                I worked for Bonelli at my winter holiday. I wanted to get some work experience
                                at some place as I just turned 18. I learned to maintain relationships with both 
                                customers and co-workers.

                            I worked for Bonelli at the end of my summer for 1 month. Even though it was not aim to
                            specialize in coffee, I admired preparing coffee and I wanted to learn more about it while
                            earning some money. Because of the management I had some difficulties but I learned how to 
                            be patient about it. I worked until my school started and I left a good impression.
